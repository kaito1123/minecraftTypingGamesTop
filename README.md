This tool enables elementary school student to practice typing, even if they are not used to operating a personal computer.　Of course, you can enjoy it from kindergarten children to adults.

# Description

This is a typing game which terms related to Minecraft are asked.　I made it so that even children who are not interested in computers can enjoy it.　English lowercase letters are difficult for children, so we set them to uppercase so that they can be judged by looking at the keyboard.　
Therefore, please set Caps Lock first and fix it to English capital letters.　

# Usage
Click the screen to start the game.　When you finish typing all the words, the number of seconds it has taken so far will be calculated.
